# Meson Player - an invisible audio player

Meson Player is a very convenient audio player if you don't need any flashy GUI to control a playback or manage playlists.
You just run it and then forget about it. The player is running in a background.
Switching tracks, volume control, loading and saving playlists, all of this can be done via global hotkeys.
